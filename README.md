# memory-game-ios-app

This repository contains the memory card game used for following along with Standford's CS193P course, and was created to finish the homeworks in that course.

This app implements a memory card game that also allows the user to create custom card themes by modifying the name of the theme, color of the cards, emojis on the cards, number of pairs to match, and a fluid UI to store and modify these themes and play the game.
